## Usage

This project consists of an R Markdown analysis (`project.Rmd`), and a dataset (`my_data.csv`). To replicate the study or explore the data with our analyses, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have R and RStudio installed.
   - Install required R packages with `install.packages(c("package1", "package2", ...))`.

2. **Download the Project Files**:
   - Clone this repository or download the files directly.

3. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Open `project.Rmd` in RStudio to view the primary analysis.
   - To execute the code and generate the report, click on "Knit" in RStudio.

4. **Explore the Dataset**:
   - Load `my_data.csv` into R using `read.csv('path/to/my_data.csv')` to explore the dataset independently.

5. **Viewing Results**:
   - The `project.nb.html` file contains the notebook version of the primary analysis. Open it in a web browser to view the results directly.
